# Topic- Polygon
Polygon comes from Greek. "Poly" means "many" and "gon" means "angle".Polygons are made of straight lines, and the shape is "closed" (it automatically connects the last point with the first). Polygons can be classified based on the number of sides they have. 
# Common types of polygons 
It include triangles (3 sides), quadrilaterals (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), hexagons (6 sides), heptagons (7 sides), octagons (8 sides), nonagons (9 sides), decagons (10 sides), and so on.
# Triangle:
A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles. Triangles can be classified based on their angles into: Acute triangle: All three angles are acute (less than 90 degrees).Right triangle: One angle is a right angle (exactly 90 degrees).Obtuse triangle: One angle is obtuse (greater than 90 degrees).
# Quadrilateral:
A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides and four angles.Quadrilaterals can have various properties and classifications, including: Parallelogram: Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.Rectangle: All angles are right angles (90 degrees).Kite: Two pairs of adjacent sides are equal in length.
