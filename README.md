# Topic- Polygon
Polygon comes from Greek. "Poly" means "many" and "gon" means "angle".Polygons are made of straight lines, and the shape is "closed" (it automatically connects the last point with the first). Polygons can be classified based on the number of sides they have. 

So I have provided introduction to polygon and an HTML code to create 3 sides polygon (Triangle) and 4 side polygon (Quadrilaterals)
